X Inc SlackBuilds

Here are some of my SlackBuilds for Slackware.


If you want use one of them, fakeroot package installed is recommended (you can
find it in linuxpackages.net or use the SlackBuild from here). With that, it's
possible to run the SlackBuilds as normal user. Creating a user only for this
task is very important too. 

slack-required files do not show true requirements, it is used more as reference
than speak the truth. :)

I like to thanks Martijn Dekker from linuxpackages.net[1] for fakeroot procedures 
for use in SlackBuilds and Slackware packages, joost witteveen, Clint Adams and
Timo Savola from Debian[2] for the great fakeroot[3], Fedora[4] and Gentoo[5] \
developers for some patches and install procedures and, of course, The Slackware
Linux Project[6] for all.

See the projects websites from more info on trademarks or other things.
