aacgain: aacgain (Normalizes the volume of digital music files)
aacgain:
aacgain: Gain normalizes the volume of digital music files using the  Replay
aacgain: Gain algorithm. It works by modifying the global_gain fields in the
aacgain: mp4 samples. Free-form metadata tags are added to the file to save
aacgain: undo information, making the normalization process reversable.
