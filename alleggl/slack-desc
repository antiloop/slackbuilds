alleggl: alleggl (A library to mix OpenGL graphics with Allegro routines)
alleggl:
alleggl: AllegroGL is an Allegro add-on that allows you to use OpenGL
alleggl: alongside Allegro -- you use OpenGL for your rendering to the screen,
alleggl: and Allegro for miscellaneous tasks like gathering nput, doing timers,
alleggl: getting cross-platform portability, loading data, and drawing your
alleggl: textures. So this library fills the same hole that things like glut
alleggl: do.
