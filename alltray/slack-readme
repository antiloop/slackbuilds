This is a standard disclaimer:

This package was built on a Slackware system running a FreeRock Gnome and KDE desktop. 
It may work in other environments but it is not recommended. It is not required to have Gnome
or KDE installed in order for this package to function properly, but any needed libraries that would
normally be present on such a system would need to be provided separately before running the
program. 

A list of the specific package required dependencies are provided in the slack-required file, but this 
may not be exhaustive and could exclude some libraries that would normally be present in a full 
KDE/GNOME environment. If this environment does not exist then it is the user's reponsibility to find 
and provide said libraries. The dependencies which are listed in the slack-required file reflect those 
present on the build system, not the minimal requirements which may be documented by the 
developer.
