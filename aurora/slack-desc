aurora: aurora (GTK theme engine)
aurora:
aurora: Aurora Gtk Engine is the latest member of the clearlooks family of
aurora: gtk engines. The goal of this theme is to provide a consistent and
aurora: complete look for Gtk. The theme aims to be very flexible in colour
aurora: choice, however the style of the theme is fixed, meaning multiple
aurora: styles for widgets will not be available. The theme includes some
aurora: features that I haven't seen before in any Gtk engine as well as
aurora: some theming of gnome panel widgets.
