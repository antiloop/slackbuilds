boost: boost (The Boost C++ Libraries)
boost:
boost: Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries. The
boost: emphasis is on libraries which work well with the C++ Standard
boost: Library, in the hopes of establishing "existing practice" for
boost: extensions and providing reference implementations so that the Boost
boost: libraries are suitable for eventual standardization. (Some of the
boost: libraries have already been proposed for inclusion in the C++
boost: Standards Committee's upcoming C++ Standard Library Technical Report.)
