dbus: dbus (D-Bus message bus system)
dbus:
dbus: D-Bus supplies both a system daemon (for events such as "new hardware
dbus: device added" or "printer queue changed") and a per user login
dbus: session daemon (for general IPC needs among user applications).
dbus: Also, the message bus is built on top of a general one-to-one message
dbus: passing framework, which can be used by any two apps to communicate
dbus: directly (without going through the message bus daemon).
