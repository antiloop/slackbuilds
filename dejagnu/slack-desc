dejagnu: dejagnu (A front end for testing other programs)
dejagnu:
dejagnu: DejaGnu is an Expect/Tcl based framework for testing other programs.
dejagnu: DejaGnu has several purposes: to make it easy to write tests for any
dejagnu: program; to allow you to write tests which will be portable to any
dejagnu: host or target where a program must be tested; and to standardize the
dejagnu: output format of all tests (making it easier to integrate the testing
dejagnu: into software development).
