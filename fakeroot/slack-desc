fakeroot: fakeroot (Set file permissions in fake root environment)
fakeroot:
fakeroot: fakeroot runs a command in an environment wherein it appears to have
fakeroot: root privileges for file manipulation. fakeroot works by replacing the
fakeroot: file manipulation library functions (chmod(2), stat(2) etc.) by ones
fakeroot: that simulate the effect the real library functions would have had,
fakeroot: had the user really been root.
