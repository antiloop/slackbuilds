ffmpeg: FFmpeg (Video and audio converter)
ffmpeg:
ffmpeg: FFmpeg is a very fast audio and video converter.  It can also grab
ffmpeg: from a live A/V source. The command line interface is designed to be
ffmpeg: intuitive, in the sense that FFmpeg tries to figure out all the
ffmpeg: parameters, when possible.  You have usually to give only the target
ffmpeg: bitrate you want.  FFmpeg can also convert from any sample rate to
ffmpeg: any other, and resize video on the fly with a high quality polyphase
ffmpeg: filter.
