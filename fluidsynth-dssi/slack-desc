fluidsynth-dssi: fluidsynth-dssi (DSSI implementation of Fluidsynth)
fluidsynth-dssi:
fluidsynth-dssi: This is an implementation of the FluidSynth soundfont-playing software
fluidsynth-dssi: synthesizer as a DSSI plugin. It makes use of DSSI's
fluidsynth-dssi: run_multiple_synths() interface to allow sharing of resources between
fluidsynth-dssi: multiple plugin instances -- soundfont data is shared between
fluidsynth-dssi: instances, and FluidSynth's usual voice allocation methods are applied
fluidsynth-dssi: across multiple instances as if each were a FluidSynth channel.
