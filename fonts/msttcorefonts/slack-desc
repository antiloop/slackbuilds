msttcorefonts:
msttcorefonts: The TrueType core fonts for the web that was once available from
msttcorefonts: http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fontpack/. The src rpm is
msttcorefonts: cleverly constructed so that the actual fonts are downloaded from
msttcorefonts: Sourceforge's site at build time. Therefore this package technically
msttcorefonts: does not 'redistribute' the fonts, it just makes it easy to install
msttcorefonts: them on a linux system.
