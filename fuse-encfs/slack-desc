fuse-encfs: fuse-encfs (Encrypted pass-thru filesystem in userspace)
fuse-encfs:
fuse-encfs: EncFS implements an encrypted filesystem in userspace using FUSE. FUSE
fuse-encfs: provides a Linux kernel module which allows virtual filesystems to be
fuse-encfs: written in userspace.  EncFS encrypts all data and filenames in the
fuse-encfs: filesystem and passes access through to the underlying filesystem.
fuse-encfs: Similar to CFS except that it does not use NFS.
