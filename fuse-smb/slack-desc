fuse-smb: With SMB for Fuse you can seamlessly browse your network neighbourhood
fuse-smb: as were it on your own filesystem. It's basically smbmount with a
fuse-smb: twist. Instead of mounting one Samba share at a time, you mount all
fuse-smb: workgroups, hosts and shares at once. Only when you're accessing a
fuse-smb: share a connection is made to the remote computer.
