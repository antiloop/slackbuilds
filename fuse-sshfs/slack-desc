fuse-sshfs: fuse-sshfs (FUSE-Filesystem to access remote filesystems via SSH)
fuse-sshfs:
fuse-sshfs: This is a FUSE-filesystem client based on the SSH File Transfer
fuse-sshfs: Protocol. Since most SSH servers already support this protocol it
fuse-sshfs: is very easy to set up: i.e. on the server side there's nothing to
fuse-sshfs: do. On the client side mounting the filesystem is as easy as logging
fuse-sshfs: into the server with ssh.
