hal: hal (The HAL Hardware Abstraction Layer)
hal:
hal: HAL is a piece of software that provides a view of the various
hal: hardware attached to a system.  HAL keeps detailed metadata for each
hal: piece of hardware and provides hooks so that system and desktop
hal: software can react to changes in the hardware configuration (such as
hal: the insertion of a DVD, or a USB flash memory stick).  Users in the
hal: "plugdev" or "cdrom" group will be able to use such devices on the
hal: desktop without the need to mount/umount them manually.
