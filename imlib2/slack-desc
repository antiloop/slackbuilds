imlib2: imlib2 (Image loading, saving, rendering, and manipulation library)
imlib2:
imlib2: Imlib 2 is a library that does image file loading and saving as well
imlib2: as rendering, manipulation, arbitrary polygon support, etc. It does
imlib2: ALL of these operations FAST. Imlib2 also tries to be highly
imlib2: intelligent about doing them, so writing naive programs can be done
imlib2: easily, without sacrificing speed. This is a complete rewrite over
imlib2: the Imlib 1.x series. The architecture is more modular, simple, and
imlib2: flexible.
