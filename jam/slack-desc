jam: jam (Program construction tool, similar to make)
jam:
jam: Jam is a program construction tool, like make. Jam recursively builds
jam: target files from source files, using dependency information and
jam: updating actions expressed in the Jambase file, which is written in
jam: jam's own interpreted language. The default Jambase is compiled into
jam: jam and provides a boilerplate for common use, relying on a
jam: user-provide file "Jamfile" to enumerate actual targets and sources.
