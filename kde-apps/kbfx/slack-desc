# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

kbfx: It improves the user experience by enabling the user to set a bigger
kbfx: (and thus  more visible) start button and by finally replacing the
kbfx: Win95-like K-Menu. But if you still want the old menu, because you're
kbfx: used to it, it is still available as an option in kbfx. We recommend
kbfx: however, that you give the Spinx bar a try.
