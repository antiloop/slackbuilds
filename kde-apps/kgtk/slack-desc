kgtk: kgtk (Allows Gtk and Qt applications to use KDE's file dialogs)
kgtk:
kgtk: This is an LD_PRELOAD library that allows Gtk and Qt applications
kgtk: (such as Firefox, Evolution, Eclipse, etc) to use KDE's file dialogs.
kgtk: When a Gtk/Qt app is executed, it starts the kdialogd app (if not
kgtk: already started), and communicates with this via a UNIX domain socket.
kgtk: There will only ever be one instance of kdialogd, and all apps
kgtk: communicate with the same instance - and it terminates itself 30
kgtk: seconds after the last Gtk/Qt app has disconnected.
