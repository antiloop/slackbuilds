libatomic_ops: libatomic_ops (Atomic memory update operations)
libatomic_ops:
libatomic_ops: Provides implementations for atomic memory update operations on a
libatomic_ops: number of architectures. This allows direct use of these in reasonably
libatomic_ops: portable code. Unlike earlier similar packages, this one explicitly
libatomic_ops: considers memory barrier semantics, and allows the construction of
libatomic_ops: code that involves minimum overhead across a variety of architectures.
