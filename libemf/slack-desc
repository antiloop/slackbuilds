libemf: libemf (A library for generating Enhanced Metafiles)
libemf:
libemf: libEMF is a library for generating Enhanced Metafiles on systems
libemf: which don't natively support the ECMA-234 Graphics Device Interface
libemf: (GDI). The library is intended to be used as a driver for other
libemf: graphics programs such as Grace or gnuplot. Therefore, it implements
libemf: a very limited subset of the GDI.
