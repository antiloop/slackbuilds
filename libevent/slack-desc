libevent: libevent (Abstract asynchronous event notification library)
libevent:
libevent: The libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a callback function
libevent: when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout
libevent: has been reached. libevent is meant to replace the asynchronous event
libevent: loop found in event driven network servers. An application just needs
libevent: to call event_dispatch() and can then add or remove events dynamically
libevent: without having to change the event loop.
