liboil: liboil (Library of Optimized Inner Loops, CPU optimized functions)
liboil:
liboil: Liboil is a library of simple functions that are optimized for
liboil: various CPUs. These functions are generally loops implementing simple
liboil: algorithms, such as converting an array of N integers to
liboil: floating-poing numbers or multiplying and summing an array of N
liboil: numbers. Clearly such functions are candidates for significant
liboil: optimization using various techniques, especially by using extended
liboil: instructions provided by modern CPUs (Altivec, MMX, SSE, etc.).
