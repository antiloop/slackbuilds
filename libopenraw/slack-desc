libopenraw: libopenraw (Decode camera RAW files)
libopenraw:
libopenraw: libopenraw is an ongoing project to provide a free software
libopenraw: implementation for camera RAW files decoding. One of the main reason
libopenraw: is that dcraw is not suited for easy integration into applications,
libopenraw: and there is a need for an easy to use API to build free software
libopenraw: digital image processing application.
