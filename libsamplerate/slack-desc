libsamplerate: libsamplerate (Sample rate conversion library for audio data)
libsamplerate:
libsamplerate: Secret Rabbit Code is a sample rate converter for audio. It is
libsamplerate: capable of arbitrary and time varying conversions. It can downsample
libsamplerate: by a factor of 12 and upsample by the same factor. The ratio of
libsamplerate: input and output sample rates can be a real number. The conversion
libsamplerate: ratio can also vary with time for speeding up and slowing down
libsamplerate: effects.
