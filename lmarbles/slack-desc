lmarbles: lmarbles (Atomix clone where you create figures out of marbles)
lmarbles:
lmarbles: LMarbles is an Atomix clone with a slight change in concept. Instead
lmarbles: of assembling molecules you create figures out of marbles.
lmarbles: Nevertheless, the basic game play is the same: If a marble starts to
lmarbles: move it will not stop until it hits a wall or another marble. To make
lmarbles: it more interesting there are obstacles like one-way streets,
lmarbles: crumbling walls and portals. As Marbles is meant as a puzzle game
lmarbles: you play against a move limit and not a time limit. This way you
lmarbles: have as much time as you need to think.http://lgames.sourceforge.net/
