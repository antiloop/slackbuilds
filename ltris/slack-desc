ltris: ltris (Game of skill with falling blocks)
ltris:
ltris: LTris as a tetris clone which means you have a bowl with blocks
ltris: falling down. By rotating and moving the blocks you try to assemble
ltris: whole lines which then disappear. LTris has three modes for this:
ltris: Classic is the classical one where you play until the bowl becomes
ltris: filled, Figures resets the bowl contents to a new figure for each
ltris: level and adds suddenly appearing tiles and lines later on and
ltris: Multiplayer where up to three players either controlled by human or
ltris: CPU(!) compete and send completed lines to each other.
ltris: Packager: _PACKAGER on _BUILD_DATE
