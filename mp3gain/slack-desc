mp3gain: mp3gain (Lossless MP3 volume adjustment tool)
mp3gain:
mp3gain: MP3Gain analyzes and adjusts mp3 files so that they have the same
mp3gain: volume. It does not just do peak normalization, as many normalizers
mp3gain: do. Instead, it does some statistical analysis to determine how loud
mp3gain: the fileactually sounds to the human ear. Also, the changes MP3Gain
mp3gain: makes are completely lossless. There is no quality lost in the change
mp3gain: because the program adjusts the mp3 file directly, without decoding
mp3gain: and re-encoding.
