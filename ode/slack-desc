ode:
ode: ODE is an open source, high performance library for simulating rigid
ode: body dynamics. It is fully featured, stable, mature and platform
ode: independent with an easy to use C/C++ API. It has advanced joint
ode: types and integrated collision detection with friction. ODE is useful
ode: for simulating vehicles, objects in virtual reality environments and
