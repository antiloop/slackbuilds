# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

opencdk: OpenCDK (Open Crypto Development)
opencdk:
opencdk: This library provides basic parts of the OpenPGP message format.
opencdk: The aim of the library is *not* to replace any available OpenPGP version.
opencdk: There will be no real support for key management (sign, revoke,
opencdk: alter preferences, ...) and some other parts are only rudimentary
opencdk: available. The main purpose is to handle and understand OpenPGP
opencdk: packets and to use basic operations. For example to encrypt/decrypt
opencdk: or to sign/verify and packet routines.
