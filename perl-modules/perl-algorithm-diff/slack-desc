perl-algorithm-diff:
perl-algorithm-diff: This is a module for computing the difference between two files, two
perl-algorithm-diff: strings, or any other two lists of things. It uses an intelligent
perl-algorithm-diff: algorithm similar to (or identical to) the one used by the Unix
perl-algorithm-diff: "diff" program. It is guaranteed to find the *smallest possible* set
perl-algorithm-diff: of differences.
