perl-event-execflow: perl-event-execflow (High level API for event-based execution flow control)
perl-event-execflow:
perl-event-execflow: Event::ExecFlow offers a high level API to declare jobs, which mainly
perl-event-execflow: execute external commands, parse their output to get progress or
perl-event-execflow: other status information, triggers actions when the command has been
perl-event-execflow: finished etc. Such jobs can be chained together in a recursive
perl-event-execflow: fashion to fulfill rather complex tasks which consist of many jobs.
