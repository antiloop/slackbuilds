perl-extutils-depends: perl-extutils-depends (Easily build XS extensions)
perl-extutils-depends:
perl-extutils-depends: This module tries to make it easy to build Perl extensions that use
perl-extutils-depends: functions and typemaps provided by other perl extensions. This means
perl-extutils-depends: that a perl extension is treated like a shared library that provides
perl-extutils-depends: also a C and an XS interface besides the perl one.
