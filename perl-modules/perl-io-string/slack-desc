perl-io-string: perl-io-string (Emulate file interface for in-core strings)
perl-io-string:
perl-io-string: The "IO::String" module provides the "IO::File" interface for in-core
perl-io-string: strings. An "IO::String" object can be attached to a string, and
perl-io-string: makes it possible to use the normal file operations for reading or
perl-io-string: writing data, as well as for seeking to various locations of the
perl-io-string: string. This is useful when you want to use a library module that
perl-io-string: only provides an interface to file handles on data that you have in a
perl-io-string: string variable.
