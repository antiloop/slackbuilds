perl-io-zlib: perl-io-zlib (Perl IO:: style interface to Compress::Zlib)
perl-io-zlib:
perl-io-zlib: This modules provides an IO:: style interface to the Compress::Zlib
perl-io-zlib: package. The main advantage is that you can use an IO::Zlib object in
perl-io-zlib: much the same way as an IO::File object so you can have common code
perl-io-zlib: that doesn't know which sort of file it is using.
