perl-test-base: perl-test-base (Data Driven Testing Framework)
perl-test-base:
perl-test-base: Testing is usually the ugly part of Perl module authoring. Perl gives
perl-test-base: you a standard way to run tests with Test::Harness, and basic testing
perl-test-base: primitives with Test::More. After that you are pretty much on your
perl-test-base: own to develop a testing framework and philosophy. Test::More
perl-test-base: encourages you to make your own framework by subclassing
perl-test-base: Test::Builder, but that is not trivial.
