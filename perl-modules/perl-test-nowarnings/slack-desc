perl-test-nowarnings: perl-test-nowarnings (Causes any warnings to be captured and stored)
perl-test-nowarnings:
perl-test-nowarnings: In general, your tests shouldn't produce warnings. This module causes
perl-test-nowarnings: any warnings to be captured and stored. It automatically adds an extra
perl-test-nowarnings: test that will run when your script ends to check that there were no
perl-test-nowarnings: warnings. If there were any warings, the test will give a "not ok" and
perl-test-nowarnings: diagnostics of where, when and what the warning was, including a stack
perl-test-nowarnings: trace of what was going on when the it occurred.
