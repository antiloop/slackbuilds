# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

progsreiserfs: 
progsreiserfs: This is a library for reiserfs filesystem access and manipulation.

progsreiserfs: which might be linked against any projects which needed reiserfs
progsreiserfs: filesystem access. There are GNU Parted, GNU GRUB, Yaboot,
progsreiserfs: Partimage, EVMS, etc. The second goal is high maintainability
