Pystromo
========
A generic input remapper for Linux

Copyright 2007 Mel Collins <mel@raumkraut.net>


INSTALLATION
============
While the actual remapping software can be run as any user, there are some
initial changes which must be made to the system as the superuser (root):

1.  cp 52-pystromo.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/

2.  Add the line "uinput" (without quotes) to the file /etc/modules

If you will want to use Pystromo before your next reboot (which is likely),
you will also need to perform the following command (also as root):

3.  modprobe uinput



UNINSTALLATION
==============

1.  rm /etc/udev/rules.d/52-pystromo.rules

2.  If you are certain that no other software on your system uses the uinput
kernel module, you can remove the 'uinput' line from your /etc/modules file.



USAGE
=====
The program which performs the remapping is called input-remapper.py
The -h or --help arguments can be used to get usage information:

$ ./input-remapper.py -h
usage: input-remapper.py [options]

options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c FILE, --conf=FILE  Use settings from the given file
  -m FILE, --map=FILE   Use mappings from the given file
  -v, --verbose         Will print out some information about found devices,
                        etc. Use this option twice to print information about
                        all incoming events, and three times (!) to display
                        outgoing events.

If no conf file is specified the 'default.conf' file will be used.
Multiple instances of both the conf and map arguments can be supplied, which
will make the input remapper use settings from all the files. Settings supplied
in latterly specified files will override similar earlier ones.

Pystromo comes with several .map files by default, based on the hardware
available to me at the moment. The most useful mapping file for learning how
they work is test.map; a collection of mappings designed to document and
demonstrate every remapping feature of Pystromo. Most of the mappings in
this file make use of input from the left-hand side of a keyboard, as that is
the default mapping for an n52. :)



CONFIGURATION
=============
The file default.conf contains information and examples of how to create your
own custom conf files. Similarly, test.map contains information and examples of
how to create your own custom input remappings.
