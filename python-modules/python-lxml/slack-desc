python-lxml: python-lxml (ElementTree-like Python bindings for libxml2 and libxslt)
python-lxml:
python-lxml: lxml provides a Python binding to the libxslt and libxml2 libraries.
python-lxml: It follows the ElementTree API as much as possible in order to provide
python-lxml: a more Pythonic interface to libxml2 and libxslt than the default
python-lxml: bindings.  In particular, lxml deals with Python Unicode strings
python-lxml: rather than encoded UTF-8 and handles memory management automatically,
python-lxml: unlike the default bindings.
