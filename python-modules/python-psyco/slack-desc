python-psyco: Psyco (The Python Specialing Compiler)
python-psyco:
python-psyco: Psyco is a kind of just-in-time (JIT) compiler, a little bit like
python-psyco: what exists for other languages, that emit machine code on the fly
python-psyco: instead of interpreting your Python program step by step. The
python-psyco: difference with the traditional approach to JIT compilers is that
python-psyco: Psyco writes several version of the same blocks, which are optimized
python-psyco: by being specialized to some kinds of variables.
