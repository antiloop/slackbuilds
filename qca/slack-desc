qca: qca (Qt Cryptographic Architecture)
qca:
qca: Taking a hint from the similarly-named Java Cryptography Architecture,
qca: QCA aims to provide a straightforward and cross-platform crypto API,
qca: using Qt datatypes and conventions. QCA separates the API from the
qca: implementation, using plugins known as Providers. The advantage of
qca: this model is to allow applications to avoid linking to or explicitly
qca: depending on any particular cryptographic library.
