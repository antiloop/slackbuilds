sqlite: sqlite (Library that implements an embeddable SQL database engine)
sqlite:
sqlite: SQLite is a C library that implements an SQL database engine. A large
sqlite: subset of SQL92 is supported. A complete database is stored in a
sqlite: single disk file. The API is designed for convenience and ease of
sqlite: use. Applications that link against SQLite can enjoy the power and
sqlite: flexibility of an SQL database without the administrative hassles of
sqlite: supporting a separate database server. Version 2 and version 3
sqlite: binaries are named to permit each to be installed on a single host.
