twolame: twolame (A optimized MPEG Audio Layer 2 (MP2) encoder)
twolame:
twolame: TwoLAME is an optimized MPEG Audio Layer 2 encoder. It is based on
twolame: tooLAME by Mike Cheng, which in turn is based upon the ISO dist10
twolame: code and portions of LAME.
twolame: Because of patent issues surrounding the MPEG Audio Layer 3 (MP3)
twolame: encoders, the ability of most MPEG Audio players to play layer 2
twolame: files, and the similarity in command-line syntax and API, TwoLAME
twolame: makes a very good drop-in replacement for LAME or other layer 3
twolame: encoders.
