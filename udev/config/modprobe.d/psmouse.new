# PS/2 mouse support:
# The default options when the psmouse module is loaded will completely
# break the mouse if you change consoles with several models of KVM
# switches.  Therefore, we'll have it use the imps protocol here, which
# is a more basic protocol that is less likely to cause problems with
# the mouse.  If you'd rather use the kernel default options, just
# comment out the line below.  If you'd rather choose your own options,
# then edit the line below as desired.
