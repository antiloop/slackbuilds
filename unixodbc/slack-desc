unixodbc: unixodbc (A complete ODBC driver manager for Linux)
unixodbc:
unixodbc: Install unixODBC if you want to access databases through ODBC. This
unixodbc: package includes low-level drivers for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and local
unixodbc: files. However, the included drivers are not as up-to-date as the
unixodbc: ones distributed separately. It is recommended that you install and
unixodbc: use the MyODBC package if you need a driver for MySQL, and/or the
unixodbc: postgresql-odbc package for PostgreSQL.
