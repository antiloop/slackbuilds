valgrind: valgrind (Tool for finding memory management bugs in programs)
valgrind:
valgrind: Valgrind is a tool to help you find memory-management problems in
valgrind: your programs. When a program is run under Valgrind's supervision,
valgrind: all reads and writes of memory are checked, and calls to
valgrind: malloc/new/free/delete are intercepted. As a result, Valgrind can
valgrind: detect a lot of problems that are otherwise very hard to
valgrind: find/diagnose.
