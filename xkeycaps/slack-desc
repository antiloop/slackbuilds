xkeycaps: xkeycaps (Graphical front end to xmodmap)
xkeycaps:
xkeycaps: xkeycaps is a graphical front-end to xmodmap. It opens a window that
xkeycaps: looks like a keyboard; moving the mouse over a key shows what KeySyms
xkeycaps: and Modifier bits that key generates. Clicking on a key simulates
xkeycaps: KeyPress/KeyRelease events on the window of your choice. It is
xkeycaps: possible to change the KeySyms and Modifiers generated by a key
xkeycaps: through a mouse-based interface. This program can also write an input
xkeycaps: file for xmodmap to recreate your changes in future sessions.
