xmms-acme: xmms-acme (XMMS plugin to use special multimedia keys through acme)
xmms-acme:
xmms-acme: This plugin was written in response to demand from the users of Acme,
xmms-acme: GNOME2's multimedia key manager. While Acme manages the association
xmms-acme: of appropriate keyboard scancodes with the media-control scancodes,
xmms-acme: it does not know how to individually control the various media
xmms-acme: players. Instead, it arranges the mapping and expects those media
xmms-acme: players to listen for the XF86Audio keysyms.
