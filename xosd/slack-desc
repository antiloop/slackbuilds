xosd: xosd (On-screen display library for X)
xosd:
xosd: XOSD displays text on your screen, sounds simple right? The difference
xosd: is it is unmanaged and shaped, so it appears transparent. This gives
xosd: the effect of an On Screen Display, like your TV/VCR etc.. The package
xosd: also includes an xmms plugin, which automatically displays various
xosd: interesting things as they change (song name, volume etc...).
