yasm: yasm (Complete rewrite of the NASM assembler)
yasm:
yasm: Yasm is a complete rewrite of the NASM assembler under the "new" BSD
yasm: License (some portions are under other licenses, see COPYING for
yasm: details). It is designed from the ground up to allow for multiple
yasm: assembler syntaxes to be supported (eg, NASM, TASM, GAS, etc.) in
yasm: addition to multiple output object formats and even multiple
yasm: instruction sets. Another primary module of the overall design is an
yasm: optimizer module.
