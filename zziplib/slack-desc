zziplib: zziplib (Lightweight library to easily extract data from zip files)
zziplib:
zziplib: The zziplib library is intentionally lightweight, it offers the
zziplib: ability to easily extract data from files archived in a single zip
zziplib: file. Applications can bundle files into a single zip archive and
zziplib: access them. The implementation is based only on the (free) subset
zziplib: of compression with the zlib algorithm which is actually used by the
zziplib: zip/unzip tools.
